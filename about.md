Here is a pool filled with all of my journals and ideas. Reading every single day. Drifting off casually, swimming slowly, flow rising and falling, and diving steadily in the stream of consciousness.

I was fond of ice skating leading me getting close to the core of my body, and of reading books guiding me healing the soul.

I'm the person easy to be tense. Just before my presentation during the last speaker's one, as I sat at my seat, I began with something nervous. My heart racing. My heart rate rising was caused by something anxious, upset, afraid of a bad presenting, and even scary. My heart racing was caused by those negative things, not by me falling in love with the last speaker.
