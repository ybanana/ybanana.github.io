Here is a pool filled with all of my journals and ideas. Reading every single day. Drifting off casually, swimming slowly, flow rising and falling, and diving steadily in the stream of consciousness.

I was fond of ice skating leading me getting close to the core of my body, and of reading books guiding me healing the soul.

#### Ice breaker, March-24, 2023
I’m one type of person who’s easy to be nervous. For example, during the presentation from last speaker, I sat there as an audience, beginning with something nervous. My heart racing. My heart racing was caused by something like anxious, upset, discomforatable, afraid of a bad presenting to come by me, and even fear. My heart racing was caused by that, not caused by falling in love with the last speaker. 

Last time I fell in love with someone was back to 12 years ago. I met her and went to marriage. She is my wife now. After 12 years, we talk less, keep in silence more. Fortunately, the silence would be broken by our child, a 6-year-old boy. He grows up as fast as his running. I see the energy in his body and happiness on his face, in his eyes. He, at home, loves running and hiding. He’s running from room to room, here and there, from one corner to another. I see him sometimes in every room, sometimes in no room. Hiding. Still. Silence. All of a sudden, he bursts out laughing. The laughing and screaming spread out all over the rooms to everyone. I see him on his stage at his age. 

Until his bedtime when he has to go to sleep. He lies on his bed, I sat, beside him, telling stories. As my voice drifts off to his ears and head, his eyes’ getting narrower and narrower till shut. That is the moment, to me, a kind of relief. I could get back to be myself. Relax in mind, and in physical. I lie on the couch in front of the TV, hold a can of beer to drink, and grab potato chips into my mouth, watching TV show or film for hours, sometimes minutes. Then it was my bedtime. I have to go to sleep, lying on the bed and opening a book. Reading. I found out reading before sleeping was good because: If I read for hours, then I’ll get the knowledge. If I read for only minutes, then I’ll get the health. A quick falling asleep. Falling asleep. Falling into a darkness, knowing nowhere, feeling empty and blank. Going over the night until the clock alarm rings. I wake up and get up, at home, getting everything done in the morning before launching, like a rocket, to the office. The moment I step into the office was the time I have to play my role as kind, nice and decent to anyone as possible. I have to be working hard and meeting focused. If tired and sleepy, I’ll take my coffee mug to fill the black coffee with no milk and drink it. By doing so, it gains me something to go on working hard and meeting focused throughout the day. 

In the office or the lab, I had small talks with colleagues. But if the topic goes somewhere outside the working things, I lost in the conversation often. I found out my words were not well organised and structured, not precise and simplified. I need to learn the common expressions. And more importantly, I need the feedback. This is the part of the reason why I joined in Toastmaster here for feedbacks from club members and also for practicing my speaking, like the one I’m doing now.

That’s it. That’s all for today. Thanks!
