### My new age
Time flows. My age had flown through 41 years, coming to 42. I've been remembering how anxious I was in 2011 when I turned to age 30. 
Back then I felt like I was so old, not young anymore. However, as I enterred 40 years old two years back, I did not get worried as before. I found out I grew a lot each year. More clear thoughts, talks, what I'd like to have and what type of person I'm going to be. Age did not mean old, but a new number. A new start. So many books to be read. So many conversation to be involved. So many challenges to be faced for home education.

I wish in the new age.
- Be kinder to Yihong. Show more loves around him.
- Be nicer and less tense to Shasha. Discuss more calmly. Have more hugs.
- Be more focused on reading books.
