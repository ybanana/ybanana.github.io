#### Sunshine all over Lindholmen port
The sun light beamed through the curtains in the office to my eyes. I got to eyebrow.

Looking down to the port, a ferry held on waiting the rushing persons as its screen said 'Avg√•r nu', like the final call when boarding in a airport. The radar or sensor stick was rolling on the top of the ferry, like a helicopter to be taking off. The ferry whose door was shutting down commenced moving as if a creature in sea ejects the water from its stomach.
