#### Rain and wind outside
The chilly rain washed Lindholmen port outside while I sat facing the monitors in the cozy office. The blurred ferries on the stream came and left the port through the winds and raindrops. 

Watching through the window, the world outside seems blurred, twisted and untrue. The world outside wanders itself. But I got different sights by the filters. What to form my filter? The sufferings I got through. The relations I involved and quited. The stories I read and watched. The self I try to get closer to.
