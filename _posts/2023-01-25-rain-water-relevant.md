#### Rain and wind outside
The chilly rain washed Lindholmen port outside while I sat facing the monitors in the cozy office. The ferries on the stream came and left the port in the winds and rains. 

Watching through the window, the world outside seems blurred, twisted and untrue. The world outside wanders regardless of how I saw it. What I saw is led to by the filters in my mind. What to form my filter? The sufferings I got through. The relations I got on and off. The stories I read and heard. The self I try to get closer to.

The blurred windshield turns to be clear by the wipers comes and goes as if a man working in a warm factory wipes the sweat on his forehead frequently.
