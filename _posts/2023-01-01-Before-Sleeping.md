## Time turns to 2023
The clock past the last minute of 2022. The sound and rhythm of fireworks from outside rushed into the bedroom where my wife and I sat close to our son who was sleeping. "Happy New Year!" We whispered to him, and to each other.

In 2022, my wife and I had countless quarrels how to be kind to our son while practicing piano. The good thing was we grown to have more clear behaviors and reacations to our son. 

Entering 2023, I would like to have me more peaceful and less outburst, to read more books, to write more words, to be much truer in conversation, to be more focus on Ming, to be calmer in my mind.

Less screen time, more work out.

Hello, 2023! I'm turning 42 age.
