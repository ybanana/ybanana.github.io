Lately, I commence the book reading of 'To the lighthouse'. So vivid, beautiful and rhythmic words wandered along the pages. It was not a easy read, which I was familiar with the switches of POV among the different characters. Complicated, profound but intersting experience. Mr. Ramsay was impressive by his behaviors, thoughts and demands of sympathy. He was so manly in front of his children with words and commands. He looked so vulnerable under Mrs. Ramsay's gaze, urging to demand the sympathy from her if he was not admired and praised so much by others. I realized I did not want to be such man.

By reading the book 'The body keeps the score', I was compelled by the story from Nancy who clearly describe what had happened to her with a surgery in which she got a huge trauma, being frustrated with no ability to speak but feeling the pain. She typically had a dual existence after surgery. Flashbacks with terror and horror. What shocked me was how she faced the trauma and recovered by another surgery to reconstruct the sense of safe.
