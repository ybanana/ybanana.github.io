## Chat with Yihong in the morning before me getting up

Yihong got up early in the morning before me waking up. He climbed up my bed, taking the Kindle to have me tell the story, Dragon Ball, which was his favourite lately. He preferred the character, Goku, while I did the opponent, Vegeta. Yihong listened to what I told for quite a while. 

We started a chat about the ‘born’.

“How’s a baby being born?” He asked.

“Dad sends out a small ball. Mom catches it, generating a big one in her belly. It grows bigger and bigger utill baby size ready to crawl out.” I answered in the way he understood more easily.

“Baby’s head first.” I highlighted.

“Was I born from where Mom poops?” he wondered.

“Not really. You were born from where Mom pees.” I smiled.

“Oh, that was not what I thought.” he giggled.

I moved on “Back then you were in Mom’s belly, she got to have regular checks in hospital. One inspection was to observe your heart development. But that day you were in a posture that your heart got hidden by the rest parts of your body. You know what? Mom took bites of fried chichens I bought in KFC to transmit some of the energy to make you turn around. Your heart SEEN.”
He laughed over and over.

“Should we get to KFC today? Let us ask Mom soon.” I had a idea popping up.

“Yeah!” He cheered up.
