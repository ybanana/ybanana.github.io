#### Why I was rough to my child
Yihong woke up and brushed his teeth under his Mom's help. He went downstairs to have the breakfast at the table. *"Wash your hands first!"* I reminded him. He'd done the hand washing, back to the table having the hotdogs with the words from me "Eat quicker! You have to stop in 10 minutes!".

He ate up two hotdogs. Washed his hands again as I demanded. Got his overall, hat and gloves on before running off the home. I walked fast even slightly rushed to the tram stop while Yihong was chasing me that hard. As we got close to the stop, the tram ran off.

*"We miss the tram at the time. We are going to do the transferred bus. You are so slow. Why didn't you walk faster as I did just now?"* I poured the words to Yihong, walking away. For a while, Yihong seemed frozen on the platform where I just complained about missing the tram out. I walked back, noticing the tears in his eyes, he being so sad that I sensed his self-blame. I don't want my kid to have any sense of shame, self-blame and guilt. I hugged him tightly, saying *"It's fine. We just missed out a tram. The next one is coming soon. No big deal. It's okay. It's okay..."* Tapping his back gently.

As we reached for Noblaskolan, Yihong took his clothes off while I was looking down at him and standing nearby like a pole. Still. I heard a voice not in Swedish but Mandarin that someone had been blaming a girl why she cannot interact with other child properly. And the girl just listened. I looked up and caught a glimpse of them, Xinyang's dad and Xinyang.

Saying bye to Yihong, I walked out of the school, thinking of why some of the parents including me have so many compliants to their child. How to be kind to my child is what I got to think about and learn deeply.
