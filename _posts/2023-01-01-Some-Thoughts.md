### Showing up what books and films I read and watched
As I read 'many' books and watched non-commercial films in 2022, showing it up to who knew me, it turned out that some of them would asked me why you got through so many 'strange' things which were far from what they read every day.
I've no idea how to answer properly if they had very different views of value from mine. It seemed they did not like someone around getting in touch with the things they never and don't like to try due to worthless.
Thus, I felt depressed about the talks tonight. But that could be my deserving if I showed up something special they thought of.

Let me dive into the books to find the calmness in my mind back again!
