#### Pain around me

Sometimes, I felt pain, speaking up to be heard and understood. But usually the pain I expressed was treated as my problem which I got to overcome. A sound around me was so clear that,
- 'Why didn't you care others' feeling, and why you make others embarrassed? Could you ignore the words you heard uncomfortable and say nothing?'
- 'What if the relation with neighbors go bad by you embarrassing others?'
- 'How should I hang out with neighbors?'

As the pain comes, the time slows down. I was getting through the suffering before falling asleep, even in the midnight half sleeping half awake. The bad feeling folded me so tightly that a sudden awake aroused, me catching a glimpse of the 80bpm heart rate on Garmin watch rather than 50 in my normal sleep.
