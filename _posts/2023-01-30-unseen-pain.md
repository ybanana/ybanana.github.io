#### Pain around me

Sometimes, I felt pain, speaking up to be heard and understood. But usually the pain I expressed was treated as my problem which I got to overcome. A sound around me was so clear that,
- 'Why didn't you care others' feeling, and why you make others embarrassed? Could you ignore the words you heard uncomfortable and say nothing?'
- 'What if the relation with neighbors go bad by you embarrassing others?'
- 'How should I hang out with neighbors?'
