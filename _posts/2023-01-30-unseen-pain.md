#### Pain around someone

Sometimes, I felt pain, speaking up it to be heard and understood. But usually the pain I pull out was treated as my problem which I got to overcome. A sound around me was so clear that,
- 'Why didn't you care others' feeling and embarrasement by ignoring the words you heard uncomfortable and saying nothing?'
- 'How does the relation with neighbors go well if you embarrase others?'
- 'How should I hang out with neighbors if you embarrase them?'
