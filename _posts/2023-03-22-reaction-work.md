In a product development, the problem would be found at any occasion. I met, on the new board produced days back, a technical one, which was brought up in the project weekly meeting. As I described the issue and solution which required design change, she, project manager, called my name for the first time to ask, raising the alarm, how severe the issue was. At the point, I sensed her growing taller and taller to stare down at me. As I talked back and explained the issue, I might be a huge dangerous monster too in her eyes. Something anxious and upset went around here and there in the meeting room. It was a odd mood I hadn't come through for a long while since moving to Sweden office.
