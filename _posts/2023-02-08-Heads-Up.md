Ethan was pissed off what had happened between Cameron and Harper, which came from his imagination. He fought with Cameron in the water before going back to the seat near which Daphine lay down.

The words Daphne said cured me in some ways. Don't think of ourselves as a victim. Be brave. Open minds.
