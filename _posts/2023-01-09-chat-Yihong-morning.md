## Chat with Yihong in the morning before me getting up
Yihong got up early in the morning before me waking up. He climbed up my bed, taking the Kindle to have me tell the comic, Dragon Ball, which was his favourate story lately. He preferred the character, Goku while I did the opponent, Vegeta. Yihong listened to what I told for quite a while. We started a chat about the born. 

> "How's one baby generated?" He asked.

> "Dad sends out a small ball. Mom catches it, generating a big one in her belly. It grows bigger and bigger till baby size ready to crawl out." I answered the way he understood easier. 

> "Baby's head first." I highlighted.

> "Was I born from where Mom poos?" he wondered.

> "Not really. You were born from where Mom pees." I smiled.

> "Oh, that was not what I thought." he giggled.

> I moved on "Back then you were in Mom's belly, she got to have regular checks in hospital. One inspect was to observe your heart development. But that day you were in a posture that your heart got hidden by the rest parts of your body. You know what? Mom took bites of fried chichens I bought in KFC to transmit some of the energy to make you turn around. Your heart SEEN then."

> He laughed over and over.

> "Should we get to KFC today? We ask Mom soon." I had a idea popped up.

> "Yeah!" He cheered.
