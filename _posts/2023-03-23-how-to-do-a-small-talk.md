#### Small talk is easy and difficult

Coffee scent is mystery and charming to reach me from time to time. I didn't bear to have a mug of coffee. In the office, I got used to taking a mug to the place where a row of coffee metal containers stands in a row, like the hedge does round the house. In front of the containers, I tapped one of them on, saw the coffee flowing into my mug, and smell its odor in the air. But the flow grew smaller, coming to a halt. 'Excuse me.' I said to servant, looking at his back towards me. He turned and replied 'What's your excuse?' Something odd discomforted me for a short while. My mind turned blank. No word. I faced another container that he just settled, staring at the coffee flow into my mug. Frozen.
Such feeling is not good for me, I know. But something echoed in my mind irritated me. How could I immune such words? I wordered, typing a unfinished email writing before taking the coffee.
