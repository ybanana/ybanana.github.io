  rating: ⭐⭐ - To be totally honest, it was pretty boring. I expected this book to cover more of the technical items behind her work and her involvement with Charles Babbages Difference and Analytical engine...but it seems more focused on genealogy, personal drama, and historical documentation of social interactions. A very small portion of the book actually covered what I had hoped. Though I think that's due to the lack of historical information available.
